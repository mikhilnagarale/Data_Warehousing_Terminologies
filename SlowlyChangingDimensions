Slowly changing diensions or SCD is keeping track of changes in dimensions attributes.

Below are types of SCD
SCD Type 1 - Here we don't keep any historical records & we keep only updated records or we directly update the records.
SCD Type 2 - Here we keep track of changes in rows . Means if any attribute or column is changed then we'll create a new row for that change.
SCD Type 3 - Here we keep the changes in columns. Means we use additional column to keep track of new change and the change date.
Eg-

Person_Details      
Name,age,state


SCD Type 3 - Person_Details
Name,age,Original State,Current State,Effective date

Note- In SCD Type 3 ine records are updated & there is limit to keep history. Benifit of SCD Type 3 is table size will not increase since the records are updated.
      Also we'll have some part of history stored in table.
      Disadvantage is we'll lost the old data once it's updated. It's been rearly used in industry.
